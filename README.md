# arctic-circle

This is a quick little project inspired by [this Mathologer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7Q8IWNfHM) animating the procedure used to demonstrate the [Arctic Circle Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_diamond).

[CreateJS](https://www.createjs.com/) is used for animations.

Hosted [here](https://jacobparish.github.io/arctic-circle/) with GitHub Pages.
